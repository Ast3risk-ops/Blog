Hi there, I'm Asterisk.

My external [about page](https://asterisk.shinken.studio/#about).

Some details on the blog:

## Privacy

- I use Cloudflare Analytics on this site. These are anonymous, privacy-conscious analytics that give me basic metrics.


- My comments section is powered by Github and is subject to the [Github Privacy Policy](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

- Any external embeds will be subject to their respective terms, which will be shown under the embed load button.

- Some images are hosted on [Tixte](https://tixte.com), and are under their [privacy policy](https://tixte.com/legal/privacy).

- Any local image files are hosted on [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com) alongside the rest of the site. Cloudflare's [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/) applies.

## Licensing

My content is under [CC BY-NC-ND 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/deed.en). Here's a summary of the license:

If you wish to share/quote the content in this blog (which you are free to do in any medium or format as dictated by the license), you must do the following:

- Attribute me as the original author, and not shovelled away at the bottom of a description page, make it obvious.

- This must be for non-commercial purposes only.

- You may not modify the material you are redistributing.

### License Exmeptions

In each case, you must also follow the other terms of the license, this mainly concerns itself with exemtpions to the **NC** (non-commercial) part of the license.

| Can I quote or reference posts on...      |  |
| ----------- | :-----------: |
| A YouTube video?     |    Yes, even if it's monetized.    |
| A podcast?   | Sure, even if there's ads on it.        |
| Some ChatGPT AdSense post? | **NO.** |
| A paid blog post/Post on a blog with ads? | [Contact me](/contact). |

I mainly don't want people directly making money from my work. You may quote sections, but you can't just steal the whole thing.

However, it is still recommended you [contact me](/contact) if you would like an exemption not covered here or have any licensing questions.
