# My rant

## The story

On the evening of August 27th, I was putting the final touches on my Chris Titus blog post. I started the hugo dev server to check the post over. I opened Dopamine 2 (my music player) at the same time. My PC (running Windows 11 pro, *ew*) did what Windows does best, and just froze. Of course this had to happen now.

After forcefully rebooting it, I wondered to myself why I hadn't gone back to Linux, which never had this issue. Why was I using an OS made by underpaid developers using nothing but duct tape and dreams and owned by a megacorp seeking nothing but dollar signs? The answer was, well, because everybody else did.

## The problem

Here's my problem. Time and time again, I see lackluster, even abysmal software support for Linux. Proton (well it was *made* for games, it gets a pass) and Wine focus too much on games that app support stagnates. Sure, I could *pay for Wine* (CrossOver) or use Bottles, but that just adds more layers of complexity or money I don't want to spend.

So, now I'm asking myself, *Why do developers not want to support Linux, the best kernel/OS/thing ever made?* Then, it dawned on me. Linux. Is. Too. Complex. Now, hold on, don't stop reading, let me explain. I realized a few key problems with Linux really stop developers from caring.

See, Linux is so custom that most support tickets for apps that support Linux *come from Linux* (data taken from BattlEye, an anticheat that supports Linux). This is a *huge* deterrent. See, users spend so much time squabbling over what distro is the best, and then making yet *another* Ubuntu derivative, they fail to see the real problem. They use different distros, kernels, package managers, libraries, desktops and configs.

When you have so many different setups, it's hard for developers to support them all. We see this with PC ports using DirectX 11 instead of 12, because 11 auto-magically handles different hardware specs and configs. However, centralization is also bad, choice is *good*.
